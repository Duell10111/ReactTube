# ReactTube

An ad free Youtube alternative developed in React-Native mainly for Apply TV, but should also work on other Android and iOS Platforms.

Main goals:

- Youtube-experience without **ADs**
- General Youtube client features

**Currently, still in development**, contributions welcome!

This project uses the [Youtube.js](https://github.com/LuanRT/YouTube.js) library to access the Youtube API.

### Building

The app can be build like any other react-native app.

You maybe have to create a **free Apple account** for building on real iOS/tvOS Devices.

**Hint:** I am currently experiencing issues after using yarn as package manager, therefore you should use npm instead.
As react native tvOS causes some peer dependency issues, you should trigger the install command with the legacy-peer-deps:
`npm i --legacy-peer-deps`

For more information look into:

- [Running on device - Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/build/internal-distribution/)

- [Running on TV - Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/building-for-tv/#build-for-apple-tv)

- [GitHub - react-native-tvos/react-native-tvos: React Native repo with additions for Apple TV and Android TV support.](https://github.com/react-native-tvos/react-native-tvos)

- [Local build README](LOCALBUILD.md)

## Troubleshooting

- #### App stuck in splash screen (Logo screen).

  Yarn v1 can cause issues with the node dependencies causing the app to never start, using npm instead can solve this issue.
  If you previously used yarn v1 you should delete the _node_modules_ and trigger a fresh npm installation.
